# 🚗 The Price Is Right: Car Auction Edition

This project is a Flask-based web game developed as a homework assignment for **STATS404 – Statistical Computing** at UCLA.

---

## 🎯 Assignment Objective

The objective of this assignment was to demonstrate the ability to:
- **Scrape real-world data from Wikipedia**
- **Clean and structure it programmatically**
- **Incorporate the data into an interactive Flask application**

---

## 🕹️ About the Game

Players are presented with 5 rare and expensive cars sold at public auction. For each car, players see:
- The **model year**
- The **car name**
- The **date it was sold**
- A **live image** scraped from Wikipedia

Players must guess the car’s **original auction price** from 5 options. Immediate feedback is provided, and a final summary is displayed at the end.

## ✅ Features

- 🔁 5 randomly selected, non-duplicate cars each game
- ⚡ Multithreaded scraping for faster image loading
- 🟢 Highlights correct/incorrect answers after each guess
- 📊 Final summary showing all responses and results
- 🧠 Clean UI using Flask and Jinja2 templates
